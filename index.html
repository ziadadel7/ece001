<h3><B>Abstract</B></h3>
The Intelligence in Wikipedia project at the University of
Washington is combining self-supervised information extraction (IE) techniques with a mixed initiative </br> interface
designed to encourage communal content creation (CCC).
Since IE and CCC are each powerful ways to produce large
amounts of structured information</br> they have been studied
extensively — but only in isolation. By combining the two
methods in a virtuous feedback cycle, we aim for substantial
synergy.<br> While previous papers have described the details
of individual aspects of our endeavor [25, 26, 24, 13], this
report provides an overview of the project’s progress and vision.

<b>Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> </br>  </br>
When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's
 because big-budget films and novels weave stories
 about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.

<p>Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, 
from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers
 and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent 
 that these can be concretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or 
 reason out any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human experience.

As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For
 example, machines that calculate basic
 functions or recognize text through optical character recognition are no longer considered to embody 
 artificial intelligence, since this 
 function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.

AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a 
cross-disciplinary approach based on mathematics, computer science,
 linguistics, psychology, and more. <hr>
 Applications of Artificial Intelligence
The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each
 of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. 
 In chess, the end result is winning the game.
  For<b> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052014/how-googles-selfdriving-car-will-change-everything.asp"> self-driving cars,</b> </a>

 the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.

Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity
 in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud 
 department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, 
 demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.</p>
