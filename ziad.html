        <h1>Database system</h1>
        <p>Databases and database technology: 
            It has a major impact on the growing use of computers. It is fair to say that databases play a critical role in almost all areas where computers are used, including business, electronic commerce, engineering, medicine, genetics, law, education, and library science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Definition 1: (Database):
            It is a collection of related data.<br>
            Definition 2: (Data)
            It is known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning.<br>
            For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. <br>
            categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data: data is raw </li>
            <li>Information: information is data that has been given meaning by way of relational connection.</li>
            <li>Knowledge: knowledge is the appropriate collection of information</li>
            <li>Understanding: appreciation of "why"</li>
            <li>Wisdom: evaluated understanding.</li>
        </ol>
        <b>types of database</b>
        <ol>
            <li>traditional database applications</li>
            <li>multimedia databases </li>
            <li>Geographic information systems (GIS) </li>
            <li>Data warehouses and online analytical processing (OLAP) systems</li>
            <li>Real-time and active database technology</li>
            <li>World Wide Web (WWW) database search techniques</li>
        </ol>

            Database properties:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld. Changes to the miniworld are reflected in the database.</li>
            <li>A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning</li>
            <li>A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users and some applications in which users are interested</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Definition 3: (Database management system (DBMS))
        It is a collection of programs enables users to create and maintain a database<br>

        <p>Definition 4: (Database system) 
        It is the database and DBMS software together<br>

        <b>Main characteristics of the database</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Self-describing nature of a database system.</li>
            <li>Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction.</li>
            <li>Support of multiple views of the data</li>
            <li>Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing.</li>

        <b>Databases Users</b>
        <p>In large organizations, many people are involved in the design, use, and maintenance of a large database with hundreds of users.<br>
        There are two types of people:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
            actors on the scene:whose jobs involve the day-to-day use of a large database; we call them the actors on the scene
                </li>
                <li>
                    workers behind the scene—those who work to maintain the database system environment but who are not actively interested in the database contents as part of their daily job.
                </li>
        </ul>

        <b>advantages of Using the DBMS Approach</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Controlling Redundancy.</li>
            <li>Restricting Unauthorized Access.</li>
            <li>Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects.</li>
            <li>Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing</li>
            <li>Providing Backup and Recovery.</li>
            <li>Providing Multiple User Interfaces.</li>
            <li>Representing Complex Relationships among Data.</li>
            <li>Enforcing Integrity Constraints.</li>
            <li>Controlling Redundancy (less storage, quick access to data).</li>
